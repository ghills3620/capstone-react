## What is Wodify?

If you've ever been to a CrossFit box (aka gym) and taken part in a WOD (workout of the day), you'll know that the whiteboard is an integral part of the whole experience: It's where the WOD is written out beforehand and where everyone's results are recorded afterward. So why get rid of whiteboards at CrossFit facilities all over the country? Because, they say, they've got something better. Needless to say, we're intrigued.

It's called Wodify, and here's how it works: Gym owners can purchase the software that helps them manage their members, along with a digital kiosk and display screen that replaces the gym's traditional whiteboard. Gym members, meanwhile, all get a free app for their smartphone. They'll use that app to check into class, record their WOD results, and manage their account; they can even sync the app with their social networks, so it's easier to brag about, errrr, share out their latest accomplishments via social media. (Forgot your phone? You can also use the kiosk to enter your info.)

Now, this isn't the first program out there designed for CrossFitters to use for tracking their workouts; a quick look through the App store will verify that. But Wodify is different because it connects everyone at a specific box together with the same program that's tailored just for the particular group; you wouldn't have to tell your app what today's WOD is, for example, because it already knows. It also helps with more practical things, like paying your bill and tracking your attendance. And, unlike a white board that gets wiped clean every day, the app automatically stores everyone's results (and workouts, duh) for future reference.

## Technologies Used

  - is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages

[Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
  - is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps.

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
  - is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## The Process

 The process of doing this project was a lot less painstaking than the last due to
 planning.  From the very begginning I started with knowing excatly what it was that
 I needed to get done and sticking to the task. Small goals large victories was how I
 was able to complete this project. One small step at a time, I have very ambitious goals
 with this project but at my level the first step was to find the simplest things and
 to do those and get it working. It doesnt matter how it looks at first it just needs to

I ran in to issues nearly everydary working on this application. To solve these
problems I looked back at the resources I had and was given. What toos are already
built for me that I can take advantage of is something I looked at for every issue.
Can I take 15 extra minutes to learn more about this and get it to work, so that my
code is more adaptable for future itterations. Also lets not forget I didnt have to
do this alone, fellow devs, stack overflow, and google were all at my finger tips
help. Ive learned alot during this process and feel more confident after finishing.
